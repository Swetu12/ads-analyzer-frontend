## 🧠 Project Overview

This AI chatbot was built with three main goals in mind:

1. **Showcase my skills** in building scalable frontend applications.
2. **Boost productivity** by creating a tool that saves time.
3. **Extend our business (Dimasc)** with a smart chatbot feature under a subdomain.

Although this is the **MVC version**, the application has much bigger potential. We're planning to integrate a custom **V0 API**, **Supabase**, and **GitHub templates** to create components, boilerplates, and configurations that allow us to start new projects with a solid base—skipping boring boilerplate code and jumping straight into the core functionality.

## 🏗️ Development Insights

### 👨‍💻 Frontend (by Alexandru Geroc)
- Built using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS 4.0**.
- Focused heavily on **code quality**, **performance**, and **scalability**.
- I adopted an architecture that's suitable for **large-scale SaaS apps**, even if this chatbot is just one small part of Dimasc.

### 💡 Technical Decisions
- **React Query** for data fetching — reduces boilerplate, improves speed, and keeps the code clean.
- **Zustand** for state management — lightweight, scalable, and easy to set up.
- **React Hook Form** for form validation — highly structured and easy to read.
- **Next.js Route Groups** (like `(foldername)`) used to isolate layouts and keep `layout.tsx` files clean and purpose-specific.

### 📁 Folder Structure
The project uses the `src` directory to keep everything organized:

src/
├── app/
├── components/
├── context/
├── data/
├── hooks/
├── lib/
├── stores/
├── types/

Each part of the codebase has a clear responsibility—for example, separate files for **mutations**, **queries**, **contexts**, and **stores**. This structure helps developers understand and navigate the project quickly.
